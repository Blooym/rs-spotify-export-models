rs-spotify-export-models
=======================

This crate contains the models for data that can be exported from Spotify by making a request for it on the Spotify website at https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/. 

Serde serialization and deserialization is supported via the `serde` feature and allows for easily converting data from an export into a Rust struct.
